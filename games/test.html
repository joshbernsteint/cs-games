<div><p>There are 131071 jars, 131070 of which contain a part of a mechanical keyboard (a CS major’s favorite to type on), and 1 of which contains… GRASS. A CS major will pass out on the spot within an hour of touching the grass in the jar (they couldn’t handle the feeling of the outdoors). What is the minimum number of CS majors needed to determine which jar has grass? </p></div>
